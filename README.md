# Neuralnetwork Backpropagation
Learn how a neural network learns through back prograpation
1. All differential equations are provided and concepts clearly explained
2. Code that trains and tests a neural network with some sample data
3. Backpropagation through stochasitc gradient descent

Topic is dense, get ready for some (simple) calculus.
